Forty hours got me goin' out my mind
Dallas dropped another game in overtime
Caught a ticket speedin' down the 65
Don't know where I'm goin'

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
Guess I really went and messed it up again
Now, my baby's goner than the Tulsa wind
Judgin' by the stone-sober state I'm in
Need to crack one wide open

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke
I'm 'bout to get on a buzz, I'm 'bout to get on a roll
Yeah, I've been breakin' my back just keepin' up with the Joneses
Y'all know what I mean, and y'all know how it goes
When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way
I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (Hey)

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]
Somebody pour me a drink
Pour me a drink

[Verse 3: Post Malone & Blake Shelton]
Bourbon-brown eyes tryna get me drunk
Ain't stoppin' 'til the bottle and the job is done
Hey, I think I might've found my future love
Buddy, you should probably buy her one

Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke
I'm 'bout to get on a buzz, I'm 'bout to get on a roll
Yeah, I've been breakin' my back just keepin' up with the Joneses
Y'all know what I mean, yeah, y'all know how it goes
When it's up on a Friday and I'm paid, slide one over my way
I can't even think when I can hear one callin' my name (Hey)

[Post-Chorus: Blake Shelton]
Somebody pour me a drink
Somebody pour me a drink

[Bridge: Post Malone]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: Post Malone & Blake Shelton]
Somebody pour me a drink, somebody bum me a smoke
I'm 'bout to get on a buzz, I'm 'bout to get on a roll
Yeah, I've been breakin' my back just keepin' up with the Joneses
Y'all know what I mean, yeah, y'all know how it goes

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone & Blake Shelton]
Somebody pour me a drink
Somebody pour me a drink
