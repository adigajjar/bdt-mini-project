Nobody, nobody, nobody (ooh)
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Yeah
I'd take the fall
I got you covered when there's no one at all
Oh, yeah, and I'd stay through the night
When you've got demons trying to break through the walls
There ain't no, no kind of line
That I wouldn't cross if you need me to
You're out here searchin' for signs
So I think it's finally time that you knew
Nobody got you the way I do (ooh)
Whatever demons you're fightin' through
When you need somebody to turn to (ooh)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do (woo)
Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Got you the way I do
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do (yeah, yeah)
When you've got dark and the night's gets so cold
I'll be on my way to you (oh yeah)
You know I ain't tryna lose you, oh, no
If you're in Hell, I'll go there too
There ain't no, no kind of line
That I wouldn't cross if you need me to
You're out here searchin' for signs
So I think it's finally time that you knew
Nobody got you the way I do (ooh)
Whatever demons you're fightin' through
When you need somebody to turn to (ooh)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do (the way I do)
Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Got you the way I do
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way, the way, the way I do
The way, the way, the way I do
Nobody got you the way I do (woo)
Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Got you the way I do (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do
Nobody, nobody, nobody, yeah (ooh)
Nobody got you the way I do
